              Showing greater respect to older adults can be done in several
              ways: acknowledging and putting to use the talents and skills of
              older adults, creating intergenerational initiatives, and allowing
              older adults to stay active and independent for as long as
              possible.

          <p>
            Older adults want to play active and meaningful roles in their
            lives, including as part of a social network, a neighborhood, and a
            community. Service providers and policymakers must consider that a
            lack of sense of purpose can become problematic as people age.
            Engaging them in leisure activities and volunteer work is important.
          </p>
          <p>
            Older adults want to stay active and contribute to society in a
            reciprocal manner (meaning that they want to exchange their services
            and skills with others for the mutual benefit of the neighborhood or
            community). Qualitative and quantitative studies published from 2005
            to 2016 examining the social needs of older adults were eligible for
            inclusion.
          </p>
          <div class="">
            <p>
              To stimulate social contacts, neighborhood initiatives can be
              developed. Social meeting places, such as pubs and churches can
              help to foster the development of close and peripheral
              relationships.

              Loneliness and social isolation are growing public health concerns
              in our aging society. Whilst these experiences occur across the
              life span, 50% of individuals aged over 60 are at risk of social
              isolation and one-third will experience some degree of loneliness
              later in life. It is vital to reduce loneliness and social
              isolation among older adults.
            </p>

              The methodology framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley and
              further developed by Levac, et al. was used to guide the scoping
              review process. A total of 33 reviews met the inclusion criteria,
              evaluating a range of interventions targeted at older people
              residing in the community or institutionalised settings.
